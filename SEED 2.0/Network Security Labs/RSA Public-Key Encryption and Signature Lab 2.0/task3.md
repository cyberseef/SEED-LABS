Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Importing Necessary Modules:**
   ```python
   from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
   ```
   The code imports the RSA module from the Crypto library, which provides the necessary functionality for RSA encryption and decryption.

2. **Defining the `decrypt_message` Function:**
   ```python
   def decrypt_message():
   ```
   This defines a function named `decrypt_message()` that will decrypt a message using the provided private key (n, d).

3. **Setting Private Key Values (n, d):**
   ```python
   n = int("DCBFFE3E51F62E09CE7032E2677A78946A849DC4CDDE3A4D0CB81629242FB1A5", 16)
   d = int("74D806F9F3A62BAE331FFE3F0A68AFE35B3D2E4794148AACBC26AA381CD7D30D", 16)
   ```
   `n` and `d` represent the private key components in an RSA encryption scheme. `n` is the product of two large prime numbers, and `d` is the private exponent.

4. **Setting the Encrypted Message (C):**
   ```python
   cipher = int("8C0F971DF2F3672B28811407E2DABBE1DA0FEBBBDFC7DCB67396567EA1E2493F", 16)
   ```
   `cipher` contains the encrypted message in integer form (ciphertext) that needs to be decrypted.

5. **Decrypting the Message:**
   ```python
   decrypted_message = pow(cipher, d, n)
   ```
   This line decrypts the encrypted message (ciphertext) using the RSA decryption formula: M â‰¡ C^d (mod n), where M is the decrypted message (plaintext), C is the encrypted message (in this case, represented as an integer), d is the private exponent, and n is the modulus.

6. **Converting Decrypted Message to Bytes and Decoding to String:**
   ```python
   decrypted_message_bytes = decrypted_message.to_bytes((decrypted_message.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='big')
   ```
   The decrypted message is converted from an integer to bytes and then decoded into a UTF-8 string.

7. **Printing the Decrypted Message:**
   ```python
   print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message_bytes.decode('utf-8'))
   ```
   Finally, it prints the decrypted message (plaintext) in UTF-8 string format.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to decrypt an encrypted message using the given private key (n, d) in an RSA encryption scheme. The encrypted message is decrypted using the RSA decryption formula, and the decrypted message is then converted to a readable string. The decrypted message is printed to the console.
