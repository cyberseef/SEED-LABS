Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code is doing:

1. **Importing Necessary Modules:**
   ```python
   from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
   ```
   The code imports the RSA module from the Crypto library, which provides the necessary functionality for RSA encryption and decryption.

2. **Defining the `calculate_private_key` Function:**
   ```python
   def calculate_private_key():
   ```
   This defines a function named `calculate_private_key()` that will calculate the private key (d) for the RSA encryption.

3. **Setting Values for p, q, and e:**
   ```python
   p = int("F7E75FDC469067FFDC4E847C51F452DF", 16)
   q = int("E85CED54AF57E53E092113E62F436F4F", 16)
   e = int("0D88C3", 16)
   ```
   The values of p, q, and e are specified in hexadecimal and converted to integers. p and q are large prime numbers, while e is the public exponent.

4. **Calculating n and φ(n):**
   ```python
   n = p * q
   phi_n = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
   ```
   n is the product of p and q, which is used in the RSA algorithm. φ(n) (phi_n) is the Euler's totient function of n, used in RSA key generation.

5. **Calculating the Private Key (d):**
   ```python
   d = pow(e, -1, phi_n)
   ```
   This calculates the private key (d) using the formula: d ≡ e^(-1) (mod φ(n)). In Python, `pow(a, b, c)` calculates a^b mod c.

6. **Printing the Private Key (d):**
   ```python
   print("Private key (d):", hex(d))
   ```
   Finally, it prints the private key (d) in hexadecimal form.

7. **Main Execution:**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       calculate_private_key()
   ```
   The `calculate_private_key` function is called when the script is run directly.

Overall, this script calculates the private key (d) for RSA encryption using the given values for p, q, and e, following the RSA key generation algorithm.
