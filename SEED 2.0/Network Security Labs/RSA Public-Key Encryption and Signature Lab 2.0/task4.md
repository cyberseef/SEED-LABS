Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Defining the Original Message and Keys:**
   ```python
   M_original = "I owe you $2000."
   d_hex = "74D806F9F3A62BAE331FFE3F0A68AFE35B3D2E4794148AACBC26AA381CD7D30D"
   n_hex = "DCBFFE3E51F62E09CE7032E2677A78946A849DC4CDDE3A4D0CB81629242FB1A5"
   d = int(d_hex, 16)
   n = int(n_hex, 16)
   ```
   `M_original` is the original message. `d` and `n` are the private and public key components (private exponent and modulus) in an RSA encryption scheme.

2. **Signing the Original Message:**
   ```python
   M_original_hash = int(M_original.encode('utf-8').hex(), 16)
   S_original = pow(M_original_hash, d, n)
   ```
   The original message is first hashed by encoding it in UTF-8, converting to hexadecimal, and then to an integer. This hash is then raised to the power of the private exponent `d` modulo `n` to generate the signature for the original message.

3. **Printing the Signature for the Original Message:**
   ```python
   print("Signature for the original message:", hex(S_original)[2:])
   ```
   The signature for the original message is printed in hexadecimal form.

4. **Modifying the Message:**
   ```python
   M_modified = "I owe you $3000."
   ```
   `M_modified` represents a modified version of the original message.

5. **Signing the Modified Message:**
   ```python
   M_modified_hash = int(M_modified.encode('utf-8').hex(), 16)
   S_modified = pow(M_modified_hash, d, n)
   ```
   Similar to the original message, the modified message is hashed and then signed using the private key components.

6. **Printing the Signature for the Modified Message:**
   ```python
   print("Signature for the modified message:", hex(S_modified)[2:])
   ```
   The signature for the modified message is printed in hexadecimal form.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how modifying the message results in a completely different signature, illustrating the integrity and authentication properties of digital signatures. Even a small change in the input message will lead to a vastly different output signature, making it infeasible for an attacker to modify a message and produce a valid signature.
