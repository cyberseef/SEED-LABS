Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Setting Public Key Values (n, e):**
   ```python
   n = int("DCBFFE3E51F62E09CE7032E2677A78946A849DC4CDDE3A4D0CB81629242FB1A5", 16)
   e = int("010001", 16)
   ```
   `n` and `e` represent the public key components in an RSA encryption scheme. `n` is the product of two large prime numbers, and `e` is the public exponent.

2. **Defining the Message to Encrypt:**
   ```python
   message = "A top secret!"
   ```
   The variable `message` contains the plaintext message to be encrypted.

3. **Converting the Message to Hex and then to an Integer:**
   ```python
   message_hex = int(message.encode("utf-8").hex(), 16)
   ```
   The `message` is first encoded in UTF-8 to obtain its binary representation, then converted to hexadecimal, and finally, this hexadecimal representation is converted to an integer. This prepares the message for RSA encryption, which typically operates on integers.

4. **Encrypting the Message:**
   ```python
   encrypted_message = pow(message_hex, e, n)
   ```
   This line encrypts the message using the RSA encryption formula: C â‰¡ M^e (mod n), where C is the encrypted message (ciphertext), M is the original message (in this case, represented as an integer), e is the public exponent, and n is the modulus.

5. **Printing the Encrypted Message (C):**
   ```python
   print("Encrypted message (C):", hex(encrypted_message))
   ```
   Finally, it prints the encrypted message (ciphertext) in hexadecimal form.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to encrypt a message using the given public key (n, e) in an RSA encryption scheme. The message is first converted to the appropriate format (integer) and then encrypted using the RSA encryption formula. The encrypted message is printed in hexadecimal form.
